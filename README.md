## Image-Encryption-and-Decryption
This is a Minor Project which is based on Encryption and Decryption of any file for privacy purposes using the logic of XOR Gate. Java Swing has been used in this project.

# About
Now a days, there are many confidential images that people store in their laptop or Desktops, but they have also given access of these devices to someone else, or by anychance,
any bad guy gets the hold of these device, so he can view these confidential images and use it against them. This will solve our problem, by this we can encrypt our image and feel free, even if someone steals the encrpyted image by your device through USB Drive or any mean, he cant open it, until and unless it is decrypted through the same application.

# Tech Stack
I have coded this project using JAVA, and designed its UI by JAVA Swing. This project has very minimal UI, in order to avoid complications.

Though This project can also be created by any other programming languages such as - C#,C++ or Python


# Result and How To Use
Step 1: Download the JAR file, given in the repository. Run it in your system.


Step 2: After Running the  JAR file, you will see a dialog box will open as it is shown in the below attachment.

Step 3: Before Clicking the 'Open File Button', first enter your CRYPTER KEY for encryption.

Step 4: After entering your Key, Click Open File and then A File explorer will open

Step 5: Navigate to the File you want to encrypt and then select it.

Step 6: Congratulations!!!!, You have successfully Encrypted your image

Step 7: For Decrypting,Repeat the same procedure, and your File will be decrypted.


# Precautions
1. Enter the same key for both encrypting and decrypting the file.
2. Always Enter the key, before opening file for both encrypting and decrypting.
3. Files with large size can take few moments for encryption or decryption. Please Have Pateince

# Conclusion
This project has been made with Java, and currently its UI have been kept extreamly simple, but few tweaks have to be made by me in UI to make this look more beautiful and appealing, the code will also be optimized a bit.
